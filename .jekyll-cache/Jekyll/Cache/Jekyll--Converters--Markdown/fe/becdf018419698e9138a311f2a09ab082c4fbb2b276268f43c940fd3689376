I"£<p>One of the most common complaints I recieved after opensourcing the theme was that the customizability of the site at the level of liquid and ruby code was extremely inaccessible to people who just wanted to get it up and running. To be honest, up until then I was under the impression that everyone using the theme were some kind of technically proficient people who just didn't have the time to whip up their own theme, and are resorting to themes such as mine just so that they could have a decent looking site to share their works. The reality only dawned upon me when I got like several emails from people involved in the digital garden subcultureâ€”most of them from outside of techâ€”told me how they liked the features but were unable to use it effectively because it was obscured by something-something-brackety-brackets-and-colons-and-equalsigns. So this is my attempt at trying to ease the customization process.</p>
