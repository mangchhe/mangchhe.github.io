I"<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I am a software engineer and a writer interested in the interplay between thoughts and constraints, the duality of interpretations and representations, and the nature of abstractions and correspondence between them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I am a long time practioner of Vipassana, but I am also a fallibilist with a slight objectivist bent. So I probably have a very different view of meditation than most people. We can talk about it if you want to.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>On this website I write articles about [[Computer Science::/tags/#Software]], [[Philosophy::/tags/#Philosophy]], Mathematics, and [[Generic Life Stuff::/tags/#General]]. Sometimes I also [[review::/tags/#Review]] books that I've read. You can find my programming side-projects on [[github::https://www.github.com/rgvr]]</p>

  <li>
    <p>I have a [[youtube channel::https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCESc8TaWpQxpHEnfhQLgzPQ]] on which I stream my work log(live writing sessions, coding sessions, reading/researching sessions, etc).</p>

::rmn]]The original design[[<strong>Original Design</strong><br /><img src="/assets/img/firstdesign.jpg" />::lsn]] of this website was a lot more ostentatious than what you see here. As I progressed through the development process of this website, the current design started emerging on its own. For reasons I don't even understand, the current design just started feeling more natural than the one I had in my mind initially. The bare and simple look-n-feel of this site, at least to me, encompasses the essence of all the things I love about the sites I frequently visit â€” feed-like structure, previews, search with context, contextual backlinks, sidenotes, etc. I am hopeful that you'll love it too. :)</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Page preview</strong> (Move your mouse over the link): [[Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet]]</li>
  <li><strong>Transclusion</strong>: Allows you to see a partial view of the contents of the website to the right or the left of the margin.</li>
  <li><strong>Sidenotes</strong> (Changelog you see on the left is an example of this).</li>
  <li><strong>Wiki-style link:</strong> Usually wikis allow you to specify links using double bracket, I added it here using liquid. Also added bad-link highlighting
    <ul>
      <li>Good link: [[Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet]]</li>
      <li>Bad link: [[Title of a page that doesn't exist]]</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
