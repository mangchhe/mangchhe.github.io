I"-<p>One of the most common complaints I recieved after opensourcing the theme was that the customizability of the site at the level of liquid and ruby code was extremely inaccessible to people who just wanted to get it up and running. To be honest, up until then I was under the impression that everyone using the theme were some kind of technically proficient people who just didn't have the time to whip up their own theme, and are resorting to themes such as mine just so that they could have a decent looking site to share their works. The reality only dawned upon me when I got like several emails from people involved in the digital garden subculture—most of them from outside of tech—told me how they liked the features but were unable to use it effectively because it was obscured by something-something-brackety-brackets-and-colons-and-equalsigns. So this is my attempt at trying to ease the customization process.</p>

<p>If you are someone with even a tiny bit of programming background, I would advice you to look into <em>'_includes'</em> folder and go to the corresponding file name and tinker with it.</p>

<p>For those of you who are not into programming, I have tried to extract as many features as I can to <em>_config.yml</em> file, so that you can at least take the advantage of some if not all the features that are customizable.</p>

<p>This table explains all the customizable variables in <em>_config.yml</em>. Most of the main variables have a property called <code class="highlighter-rouge">enabled</code>, which when set to true will enable the main variable. For eg. turn on subheading by setting the enabled property to true, if it is already true, set it to false and see what happens.</p>
